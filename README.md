# 🧠 Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on Fashion MNIST

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)** to generate fashion items using the **Fashion MNIST** dataset, built using **PyTorch**.

## 🔍 Overview

- The **Generator** learns to produce realistic fashion images.
- The **Discriminator** learns to differentiate between real and fake (generated) images.
- Both networks improve iteratively via adversarial training.
